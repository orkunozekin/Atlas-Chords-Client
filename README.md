# Atlas Chords

Atlas Chords has been designed for those who are learning the basic guitar chords.
These chords are a key part of mastering the basic guitar skills. 
Users can search and find the 14 basic guitar chords on this app. 
They can also submit a chord to demonstrate their skills. 

## Motivation

When I first started learning guitar in 2006, I was eager to learn one guitar chord after another. I wasn't able to find an app that outright displayed guitar chords based on users' search. 
That's why I was motivated to create an app that makes the process of finding the basic guitar chords with ease for future guitar players. 

## Tech/Frameworks Utilized:
React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
